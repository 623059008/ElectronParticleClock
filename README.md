# ElectronParticleClock
This is a minimal clock. The first demo I made for learning electron.

### Dependencies
NodeJs
npm tools
Electron

### Quick Start
```
npm install
npm start
```

### Pack for your OS
```
sudo npm install -g asar
sudo npm install -g electron-packager
```

The part of particle clock is found in an open-source website,
I think you can find this project on codepen.io, but I did not find it.
And I want to develop it further as Electron application.
